# Sudoku-Game
Hello everyone This is Srajit and i have completed one easy game of sudoku. This code allows the user to input values into the Sudoku grid and checks if the move is valid.
Here is the Key components of the Game -
Grid Representation: The Sudoku grid is represented as a 2D array of integers. Zeros represent empty cells.
Display Grid: The displayGrid function shows the current state of the Sudoku board in a user-friendly format.
Check Validity: The isSafe function checks if placing a particular number in a given cell is valid according to Sudoku rules.
User Input: The user inputs the row, column, and number they wish to place in the grid.
Game Loop: The game continues until all cells are filled. The program checks each move for validity before allowing it.
